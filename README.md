## TIG Welding : 
Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding, also known as Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW)  is an arc welding process that produces the weld with a non-consumable tungsten  electrode. In the TIG welding process the arc is formed between a pointed tungsten  electrode and the workpiece in an inert atmosphere of argon or helium. When filler metal is required, it must be added separately to the  weld pool.
